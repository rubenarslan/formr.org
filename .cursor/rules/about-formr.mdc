### About the app
- formr is an app on a PHP + MariaDB + JavaScript/jQuery stack. 
- We use composer for PHP dependency management and NPM/Webpack for JS/CSS dependencies.
- formr is used to generate studies, i.e. complex surveys. Each study can be a progressive web app, which should largely be self-coom other studies. That means the manifest at [manifest_template.json](mdc:templates/run/manifest_template.json) is only used as a template
