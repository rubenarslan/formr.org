<h3>formr <i>Runs/Studies</i></h3><hr />
<p>
    A formr "run" contains your study's complete design. All the things that a single participant is going to do in your study should take place in one run. Designs can range from the simple (a single survey or a randomised experiment) to the complex (like a diary study with daily reminders by email and text message or a longitudinal study tracking social network changes).

                    Inside a run, participants' data is connected, so you can track how many times a participant filled out her diary or whether her social network grew in size since the first measurement time point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, why "run"? In formr, runs consist of simple modules that are chained together linearly. Because most modules are boombox-themed, it may help to think of a tape running. Using controls such as the skip backward button, the pause button and the stop button, you control the participant's progression along the run. Surveys can be thought of as the record button: whenever you place a survey in your run, the participant can input data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data for the control units are supplied on-the-fly to the statistics programming language R. Therefore, you can dynamically generate feedback graphics for your participants with minimal programming knowledge. With more programming knowledge, nothing keeps you from making full use of R. You could for example conduct complex sentiment analyses on participants' tweets and invite them to follow-up surveys only if they express anger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since runs contain your study's complete design, it makes sense that runs' administration side is where every user management-related action takes place. There is a user overview, where you can see at which position in the run each participant is and when they were last active. Here, you can send people custom reminders (if they are running late), shove them to a different position in the run (if they get lost somewhere due to an unforeseen complication) or see what the study looks like for them (if they report problems).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Runs are also where you customise your study's look, upload files (such as images, videos, Javascript files), control access and enrollment. In addition, there are logs of every email sent, every position a participant has visited and of automatic progressions.

                    Surveys are series of questions (or other items) that are created using simple spreadsheets/<a href="<?= site_url('public/documentation#sample_survey_sheet') ?>">item tables</a> (e.g. Excel).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Survey item tables are just spreadsheets and they can just as easily be shared, reused, recycled and collaboratively edited using e.g. Google Sheets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Surveys can remain fairly simple: a bunch of items that belong together and that a participant can respond to in one sitting. For some people, simple surveys are all they need, but in formr a survey always has to be part of a (simple) run/study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Surveys can feature various items, allowing e.g. numeric, textual input, agreement on a Likert scale, geolocation and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Items can be optionally shown depending on the participant's responses in the same survey, in previous surveys and entirely different data sources (e.g. data gleaned from Facebook activity). Item labels and choice labels can also be customised using <a href="<?= site_url("public/documentation#knitr_markdown") ?>">knitr</a>, so you can e.g. refer to a participant's pet or last holiday location by name or use people's preferred term of address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you use R, formr includes a few nice timesavers in its <a href="https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr"><i class="fa fa-github-alt fa-fw"></i> R package on Github</a>. Data import can be automated without any funny format business. Items will be correctly typed according to the item table, not according to flawed heuristics. You will also have item and value labels available in R. <br>
                    If you name your items according to the schema <code>BFI_extra_2<i>R</i></code>, items with an R at the end can be automatically reversed and items ending on consecutive numbers with the same prefix will be aggregated to a mean score (with the name of the prefix). Using our <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=codebook">R package <i>codebook</i></a> you can then document the data, as well as automatically generate internal consistency analyses and item frequency plots. Hence, some tedious manual data wrangling can be avoided, especially if you start giving your items meaningful and memorable names early on. The <i>formr::</i> functions are also always available, whenever you use R inside formr runs and surveys.

                    These are external links - use them to send participants to other, specialised data collection modules, such as a social network generator, a reaction time task, another survey software (we won't be too sad), anything really. However, you can also simply call upon external functionality without sending the participant anywhere â€“ one popular application of this is sending text messages via an R <abbr class="initialism" title="Application programming interface.">API</abbr> call.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you insert the placeholder <code>{{login_code}}</code>, it will be replaced by the participant's run session code, allowing you to link data later (but only if your external module picks this variable up!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, you may find yourself wanting to do more complicated stuff like <b>(a)</b> sending along more data, the participant's age or sex for example, <b>(b)</b> calling an <abbr class="initialism" title="Application programming interface.">API</abbr> to do some operations before the participant is sent off (e.g. making sure the other end is ready to receive, this is useful if you plan to integrate formr tightly with some other software) <b>(c)</b> redirecting the participant to a large number of custom links (e.g. you want to redirect participants to the profile of the person who last commented on their Facebook wall to assess closeness) <b>(d)</b> you want to optionally redirect participants back to the run (e.g. as a fallback or to do complicated stuff in formr).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can either choose to "finish/wrap up" this component <em>before</em> the participant is redirected (the simple way) or enable your external module to call our <abbr class="initialism" title="Application programming interface.">API</abbr> to close it only once the external component is finished (the proper way). If you do the latter, the participant will always be redirected to the external page until that page makes the call that the required input has been made.

                    Push notifications are a way to send notifications to participants. To be able to use them, you need to generate an application manifest in the run settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The manifest is a JSON file that describes your app. It is used to generate a PWA and a shortcut icon on the participant's device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once your study has a manifest, you can add special items (see App section of <a href="<?= site_url('documentation#available_items') ?>">available items</a>) like <code>add_to_homescreen</code> to your surveys. This will add a button to the participant's device that allows them to add your study to their homescreen. <code>request_phone</code> will guide the user to switch to a mobile device. And <code>push_notification</code> will ask the user to allow push notifications for your study. You can also insert the <code>request_cookie</code> item to explicitly ask participants to allow functional cookies which won't expire when the app is closed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sending push notifications to the user can be configured in the run. You can define when a notification should expire, what message should be shown, whether the user needs to interact with the notification, whether it is silent or whether it should vibrate. Push notifications are automatically dismissed once the user opens the app. As long as push notifications exist, a badge counter (1) will be shown on the app on the operating systems that support it.

                    Using an SMTP account (most email addresses come with one) that you can <a href="<?= site_url("admin/mail") ?>">set up in the mail section</a>, you can send emails to your participants, their friends or yourself. Using the tag <code>{{login_link}}</code>, you can send participants a personalised link to the run. You can also use <code>{{login_code}}</code> to use the session code to create custom links, e.g. for inviting peers to rate this person (informants). Many ISPs limit using their SMTP server to send automated email. Gmail users cannot send more than 500 emails a day and have to disable some advanced security features. Vendors like <a href="https://sendgrid.com">Sendgrid</a> offer free student accounts as part of the <a href="https://education.github.com/">Github education pack</a> and are more amenable to automated emails via SMTP.

Before they see the page marked by the stop point, an email is sent off to <em>youremailaddress@example.org</em> - this way you (or whoever's email address you use here) would get an email notification for every participant. This might be helpful in longitudinal surveys where experimenter intervention is required to e.g. set up a phone interview, in an assessment context when you want the scores to be automatically generated, or in a clinical study where you want to do a structured interview after a screening task.

                    The condition is specified in R and all necessary survey data is automatically available. The simplest condition would be <code>TRUE</code> â€“ always skip back, no matter what. A slightly more complex one is <code>nrow(diary) &lt; 14</code>, this means that the diary must have been filled out at least fourteen times. Even more complex: <code>nrow(diary) &lt; 14 | !time_passed(days = 20, time = first(diary$created))</code>, this means that at least 20 days must have passed since the first diary was done and that at least 14 diaries must have been filled out. But any complexity is possible, as shown in Example 2.

After completion, the Skip Backward would send them back to the pause, where you could thank them for completing today's diary and instruct them to close their web browser. Automatically, once it is 6PM the next day, they would receive another invitation, complete another diary etc. Once this cycle repeated 14 times, the condition would no longer be true and they would progress to position 60, where they might receive feedback on their mood fluctuation in the diary.

                    In this scenario, the participant takes part in the short survey first. We obtain the geolocation, which can be used to retrieve the local weather using API calls to weather information services in the Skip Backward at position 30. The weather gets checked once each day (pause at 20) and if there ever is a thunderstorm in the area, the participant is invited via email (40) to take a survey (50) detailing their experience of the thunderstorm. This way, the participants only get invited when necessary, we don't have to ask them to report weather events on a daily basis and risk driving them away.

After the invitation, however, we don't just give up, if they don't react. After another week has passed (one week in the host country), we remind them.<br>
                    How is this done? We set a waiting time for the participant of 7 days. <br>
                    Now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVHVZksFRZg#t=0m39s">if he doesn't answer</a> for one week, the run will automatically go on to 40, to our email reminder (tentatively titled "Oh lover boy..."). We hope the participant clicks on the link in our invitation email before then though.<br>
                    If he does, he will jump to the survey at position 60.<br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVHVZksFRZg#t=0m43s">If he still doesn't answer</a>, we will patiently wait for another seven weeks. This time, we set an expiry time in the survey settings to achieve this. Until seven weeks have passed he can do the survey. Once the seven weeks are over without him finishing the survey, the run moves on to the next position, which stands for waiting for return home, i.e. we gave up on getting a reaction in the first wave (but we still have "Baby, oh baby, My sweet baby, you're the one" up our sleeve).

                    If you combine these end points with Skip Forward, you can have several in your run: You would use the Skip Forward to check whether participants are eligible, and if so, skip over the stop point between the Skip Forward and the survey that they are eligible for. This way, ineligible participants end up in a dead end before the survey. In the edit run interface, you can see green counts of the number of people on this position on the left, so you can see easily how many people are ineligible by checking the count.<br>

                    This is a very simple component. You simply choose how many groups you want to randomly assign your participants to. We start counting at one (1), so if you have two groups you will check <code>shuffle$group == 1</code> and <code>shuffle$group == 2</code>. You can read a person's group using <code>shuffle$group</code>. If you generate random groups at more than one point in a run, you might have to use the last one <code>tail(shuffle$group,1)</code> or check the unit id <code>shuffle$unit_id</code>, but usually you needn't do this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you combine a Shuffle with Skip Forward, you could send one group to an entirely different arm/path of the study. But maybe you just want to randomly switch on a specific item in a survey - then you would use a "showif" in the survey item table containing e.g. <code>shuffle$group == 2</code>. The randomisation always has to occur before you try to use the number, but the participants won't notice it unless you tell them somehow (for example by switching on a note telling them which group they've been assigned to).
