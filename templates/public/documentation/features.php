<p class="lead">
    The following designs and many more are possible:
</p>
<ul class="fa-ul-more-padding">
    <li>simple surveys with and without feedback
    </li>
    <li>complex surveys (using skipping logic, personalised text, complex feedback)
    </li>
    <li>surveys with eligibility limitations
    </li>
    <li>diary studies including completely flexible automated email/text message reminders</li>
    <li>longitudinal studies (e.g. automatically re-contact participants after they return from their exchange year). The items of later waves need not exist in final form at wave 1.</li>
    <li>longitudinal social networks and other studies that require rating a variable number of things or persons</li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Core strengths
</h2>
<ul class="fa-ul-more-padding">
    <li>
        generates very pretty feedback live, including <a href="https://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a>, and interactive <a href="https://ggvis.rstudio.com">ggvis</a> plots and <a href="https://www.htmlwidgets.org">htmlwidgets</a>. We find that this greatly increases interest and retention in our studies. 
    </li>
    <li>
        automates complex experience sampling, diary and training studies, including automated reminders via email, push notifications, or text message
    </li>
    <li>
        looks nice on a phone (about 30-40% of participants fill out our surveys on a mobile device), can be installed as a PWA (Progressive Web App) on the home screen
    </li>
    <li>
        easily share, swap and combine surveys (they're simply spreadsheets) and runs (you can share complete designs, e.g. "daily diary study")
    </li>
    <li>
        you can use R to do basically anything that R can do (i.e. complicated stuff, like using a sentiment analysis of a participant's Twitter feed to decide when the survey happens)
    </li>
    <li>
        not jealous at all â€“ feel free to integrate other components (other survey engines, reaction time tasks, whatever you are used to) with formr, we tried our best to make it easy.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Features
</h2>
<ul class="fa-ul-more-padding">
    <li>
        manage access to and eligibility for studies
    </li>
    <li>
        longitudinal studies
    </li>
    <li>
        send text messages (see the <a href="https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr.org/wiki/How-to-send-text-messages-(SMS)">HowTo</a>) and push notifications
    </li>
    <li>
        works on all somewhat modern devices and degrades gracefully where it doesn't
    </li>
    <li>
        formats text using <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/">Github-flavoured</a>  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/">Markdown</a> (a.k.a. the easiest and least bothersome way to mark up text)
    </li>
    <li>
        file, image, video, sound uploads for users (as survey items) and admins (to supply study materials)
    </li>
    <li>
        complex conditional items
    </li>
    <li>
        a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr/">formr R package</a>: makes pretty feedback graphs and complex run logic even simpler. Simplifies data wrangling (importing, aggregating, simulating data from surveys).
    </li>
    <li>
        a nice editor, <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace">Ace</a>, for editing Markdown &amp; R in runs.
    </li>

</ul>
<h3>
    Plans:
</h3>
<ul class="fa-ul-more-padding">
    <li>
        work offline on mobile phones and other devices with intermittent internet access (in the meantime <a href="https://enketo.org/">enketo</a> is pretty good and free too, but geared towards humanitarian aid)
    </li>

    <li>
        a better API (some basics are there)
    </li>
    <li>
        social networks, round robin studies - at the moment they can be implemented, but are a bit bothersome at first. There is a dedicated module already which might also get released as open source if there's time. 
    </li>
    <li>
        more <a href="https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr.org/issues?labels=enhancement&amp;page=1&amp;state=open">planned enhancements on Github</a>
    </li>
</ul>

enable you to link surveys and chain them together. Using a number of boombox-themed control elements to control the participant's way through your study, you can design studies of <abbr title="All of these boombox-controls know R, so though you don't have to be an R-wizard to run a study with formr, it certainly helps with the limitless complexity aspect.">limitless</abbr> complexity.

<ul>
    <li>manage access to and eligibility for a study:

            <i class="fa-fw fa fa-forward"></i>
            <i class="fa-fw fa fa-stop"></i>
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>use different pathways for different users:

    <li>give custom feedback, through <a href="https://public.opencpu.org/pages">OpenCPU</a>'s R API.
        <span class="">
            <i class="fa-fw fa fa-stop"></i>
