# Formr.org Change Log (check previous change logs in CHANGELOG-v1.md)

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [v0.24.0] - 24.05.2025
### Added
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support. 
  - Formr studies can now be turned into apps that are installable to devices running Android, iOS, MacOS, Windows, etc.
  - Each study is its own app
      - Service worker and configurable manifest endpoints for each run/study.
      - Logos, names, settings are configurable
  - Push message support in the run
  - Surveys get three new items: request_phone, add_to_home_screen, and push_notification which help configure the app
- Switch from grunt/bower to npm/webpack for clientside dependencies

### Fixes
- Cookies are now set to SameSite: Lax, so that cookies are always set upon first visit to the page

## [v0.23.0] - 23.01.2025
### Added
* Added two-factor authentication (2FA) thanks to groundwork by @EliasAhlers and @Epd02
  * 2FA is now enabled by default
  * 2FA can be made required for all users
  * The formr R package now supports 2FA
* Runs/Studies can now be exported noninteractively
  * This enables a new R package function `formr::formr_backup_study()` which can be used to export runs/studies, all user data, and all user uploaded files
* Authentication was improved
  * Minimal wait times to avoid timing attacks and brute force attacks
* Process runs that need to be reminded or deleted (thanks to @eliasheithecker for some groundwork) for simpler compliance with GDPR and other regulations
  * Autodeletion is not turned on by default, but can be required in settings.php
  * We loop over the reminder intervals and process the runs that need to be reminded or deleted.
  * Reminders are sent 6, 2, and 1 month(s) and 1 week and 1 day before expiry.
  * To avoid spamming, we only send a reminder if the run has not received a reminder in the last 6 days.
  * If the study owner has received 2 reminders and the first reminder was at least two weeks ago, we delete the run data.
  * The expiry routine is configured in such a way that run data may not be deleted on the day of expiry if the study owner was not given sufficient notice (e.g., because of problems with the email server or because they recently changed their expiry date).
* Orphaned files which were uploaded within a survey are now automatically deleted every night.

### Fixed
* User account deletion is now working again
* link to ToS on signup page was incorrect

## [v0.22.0] - 01.10.2024
## [v0.22.0] - 19.12.2024

* issues with file uploads in the survey where error messages were not displayed, could be cryptic
* maxlength for textarea items was not respected
* fixed an issue where a minimum of 0 for number-type inputs was not respected

### Changed
* when you upload a survey from a Google spreadsheet, the name of a survey is now automatically read from the spreadsheet file. The name set in formr has to match the Google spreadsheet name to ensure consistency
* documentation has been updated for item types, on how formr auto-enriches data in R code etc. In addition, documentation is available in more places.

### Added
* compliance work
  * added special user-facing static pages for privacy policy and terms of service
  * added an option to require that a privacy policy exists before studies go public
  * improved default footer text/imprint to include admin email address, links to privacy policy, ToS, settings, make referral tokens optional
  * added setting for extended agreements to conditions when uploading files in runs
* audio type items, including `record_audio` class for a recorder button
* video type items
* the submit button item now allows for negative "timeouts" â€” i.e. the user has to wait until they can submit

### Fixed
* fixed broken redirects to the login page
### Added
* make it easier to dockerise formr
  * added a setting to send error logs to stderr
  * adapted OpenCPU handling to make it possible to POST (run R commands) to a different URL (e.g., inside a docker network) than where we GET results (e.g., render user-facing feedback). If the old setting base url is used, it should be used for both POST and GET.
* improve cookie handling, 
  * formr now works similarly, whether you use study-specific subdomains or not. 
  * cookies are now always valid only for the specific domain on which they were set. 
  * we now recommend hosting the admin area on a different subdomain than the studies, not on the top level domain.
  * removed redundant settings related to cookies from settings.php
