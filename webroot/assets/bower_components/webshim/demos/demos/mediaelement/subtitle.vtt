00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is an example for our track support

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.000
We have implemented the track element and the TextTrack API

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:17.000
You can use <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <u>underline</u> and <c.customstyle>custom classes</c> to style

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:25.000
Your cues can...

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
...overlap...

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
...really.

7
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:34.000
You can also use the text track API, to build upon. It's really more than just subtitles/captions.

custom-id
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Just play with it

8
00:00:46.100 --> 00:02:18.000
This is the end of our subtitles
