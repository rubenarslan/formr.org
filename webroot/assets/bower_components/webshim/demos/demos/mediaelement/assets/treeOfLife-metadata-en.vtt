"title": "Multi-celled organisms", 
"description": "Multi-celled organisms have different types of cells that perform specialised functions. Most life that can be seen with the naked eye is multi-cellular. These organisms are though to have evolved around 1 billion years ago with plants, animals and fungi having independent evolutionary paths.",

"title": "Insects", 
"description": "Insects are the most diverse group of animals on the planet with estimates for the total number of current species range from two million to 50 million. The first insects appeared around 400 million years ago, identifiable by a hard exoskeleton, three-part body, six legs, compound eyes and antennae.",

fish

{
"title": "Fish", 
"description": "Fish are aquatic creatures characterised by having backbones and fins. They are typically cold-blooded. The early fossil record on fish is not very clear. Scientists think they grew in number as a result of having hinged jaws because jawless fish left very few descendants.",

amphibians
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:57.200
{
"title": "Amphibians", 
"description": "Amphibians such as frogs, toads and newts, are cold-blooded animals that metamorphose from a juvenile, water-breathing form to an adult, air-breathing form. Unlike other land animals, amphibians lay eggs in water as their fish ancestors did. The first amphibians were around one to five metres long.",

reptiles
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:39.200
{
"title": "Reptiles", 
"description": "Reptiles are superficially similar to amphibians but there are key differences. Their skin is covered with scales or plates and they do not need to lay eggs in water. The oldest trace of reptiles is a series of footprints from the fossil strata of Nova Scotia dated as 315 million years old.",

birds
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:49.200
{
"title": "Birds", 
"description": "Modern birds are characterised by feathers, a beak with no teeth, the laying of hard-shelled eggs and a lightweight but strong skeleton. The earliest known bird Archaeopteryx (from the Ancient Greek words for ancient and feather) has been dated to around 150 million years ago.",

mammals

{
"title": "Mammals", 
"description": "Mammals are a class of animal characterised by having hair or fur. Their females produce milk for the sustenance of the young and they have advanced brains which they use for sensory perception and conscious thought. Mammals began to appear around 200 million years ago, humans just 200,000 years ago.",
