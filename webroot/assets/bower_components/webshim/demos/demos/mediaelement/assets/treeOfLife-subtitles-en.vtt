00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.600
A hundred and fifty years after the publication of Darwin's revolutionary book,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.600
modern genetics has confirmed its fundamental truth: all life is related. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.200
And it enables us to construct with confidence 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.400
the complex tree that represents the history of life. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.200
It began in the sea, some 3000 million years ago. 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.600
Complex chemical molecules began to clump together to form microscopic blobs: cells.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.200
These were the seeds from which the tree of life developed.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.000
They were able to split, replicating themselves - as bacteria do. 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.800
And as time passed they diversified into different groups. 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.600
Some remained attached to one another so that they formed chains. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.800
We know them today as algae. 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.800
Others formed hollow balls which collapsed upon themselves, creating a body with an internal cavity. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.000
They were the first multi-celled organisms. Sponges are their direct descendants.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.800
As more variations appeared the tree of life grew and became more diverse.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.000
Some organisms became more mobile and developed a mouth that opened into a gut.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.000
Others had bodies stiffened by an internal rod.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.200
They, understandably, developed sense organs around their front end.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.600
A related group had bodies that were divided into segments 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.200
with little projections on either side that helped them to move around on the sea floor. 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.200
Some of these segmented creatures developed hard protective skins 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.000
which gave their bodies some rigidity. 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.400
So now, the seas were filled with a great variety of animals.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.000
And then around 450 million years ago some of these armoured creatures 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.800
crawled up out of the water and ventured on to the land.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.200
And here the tree of life branched in to a multitude of different species

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.000
that exploited this new environment in all kinds of ways.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.600
One group of them developed elongated flaps on their backs, 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.600
which over many generations eventually developed into wings. 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.600
The insects had arrived.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.600
Life moved into the air and diversified into myriad forms.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.400
Meanwhile, back in the seas, those creatures with a stiffening rod in their bodies 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.000
had strengthened it by encasing it in bone. 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.800
A skull developed with a hinged jaw that could grab and hold on to prey

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
They grew bigger and developed fins

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.200
equipped with muscles that enabled them to swim with speed and power. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So fish now dominated the waters of the world.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.400
One group of them developed the ability to gulp air from the water surface.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.000
Their fleshy fins became weight-supporting legs

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.600
and 375 million years ago, a few of these backboned creatures followed the insects on to the land. 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.800
They were amphibians with wet skins and they had to return to water to lay their eggs.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.200
But some of their descendants evolved dry scaly skins and broke their link with water 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.400
by laying eggs that had watertight shells.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.800
These creatures, the reptiles, were the ancestors of today's tortoises, snakes, lizards and crocodiles. 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.200
And of course, they included the group that, back then, came to dominate the land: the dinosaurs.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.000
But 65 million years ago, a great disaster overtook the Earth.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.800
Whatever its cause, a great proportion of animal life was exterminated. 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.800
All the dinosaurs disappeared - except for one branch, 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.400
whose scales had become modified into feathers. 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.800
They were the birds.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.800
While they spread through the skies, a small and seemingly insignificant group of survivors 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.000
began to increase in numbers on the ground beneath.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.000
These creatures differed from their competitors in that their bodies were warm

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.400
and insulated with coats of fur.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.800
They were the first mammals.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.600
With much of the land left vacant after the great catastrophe they now had their chance. 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Their warm insulated bodies enabled them to be active at all times, 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.800
at night as well as during the day,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.600
and in all places: from the Arctic to the tropics, 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.600
in water as well as on land,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
on grassy plains and up in the trees.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.000
Today we and the rest of the mammals share the world 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.200
with the descendants of those other great animal groups that have evolved on this planet:

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.800
with birds and with reptiles, with insects and with fish,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.800
and even with those simplest of all living organisms

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.800
that first appeared over 3000 million years ago: with bacteria.
